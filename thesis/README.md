# KSE Thesis Template

This is (currently) unofficial template for a Bachelor thesis at the Kyiv School of Economics.

## Using the template

1. Fork this repository

2. Fill in the metadata in the `metadata.typ` file.

3. Write your content in the `thesis.typ` file as well as the other files in the `main/` folder.

## Usage

In order to build the `Typst` document locally you can use one of the following command:

```bash
# Create pdf
typst compile thesis.typ

# Create pdf and watch for changes
typst watch thesis.typ
```

OR you can use Visual Studio Code with the `Tinymist Typst` extension. This will allow you to edit the document and see the changes in real-time.

## Help

If you need help writting your document look at the [Typst documentation](https://typst.app/docs/) or if ou need more help with the template specifics look at the document [Guide-to-Typst](https://github.com/hei-templates/hei-synd-thesis/blob/main/guide-to-typst.pdf)
